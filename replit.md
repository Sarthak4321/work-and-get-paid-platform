## Architecture

### Current Implementation (Local Storage)
- **Authentication**: Email/password stored in localStorage
- **Data Storage**: All user, task, and payment data in localStorage/sessionStorage
- **AI Integration**: Gemini Flash API for knowledge checks and task matching

### Firebase Migration Path
The codebase is structured for Firebase integration:

1. **Authentication**: Replace custom auth with Firebase Authentication
   - Update `pages/login.tsx` and `pages/signup.tsx` to use Firebase Auth
   - Remove password field from User interface (Firebase handles this)

2. **Database**: Replace localStorage with Firestore
   - Update `utils/storage.ts` to use Firestore async methods
   - Convert all `storage.getX()` calls to async/await
   - Add loading states to all components

3. **File Structure for Firebase**:
   ```
   utils/
     firebase.ts          # Firebase config and initialization
     auth.ts             # Auth service wrapper
     firestore.ts        # Firestore data operations
   ```

4. **Required Changes**:
   - Install Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
   - Create Firebase project and add config
   - Update all data fetching to async/await
   - Add error handling for network failures
   - Implement real-time listeners for live updates

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **AI**: Google Gemini Flash (free tier)
- **State**: Local/Session Storage (Firebase-ready)
- **Date Handling**: date-fns

## Development

### Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server runs on http://localhost:5000

### Environment Variables
For Gemini AI features, users can provide their API key during signup (optional):
- Get free API key from: https://ai.google.dev

## Security Notes
- Passwords stored in plain text for demo (use Firebase Auth in production)
- All data in browser storage (use Firestore in production)
- No server-side validation (implement with Firebase Cloud Functions)

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time task notifications
2. Chat system for admin-worker communication
3. Advanced analytics and reporting
4. Mobile app version
5. Integration with payment gateways
6. Automated task matching using Gemini AI
7. Performance reviews and ratings
